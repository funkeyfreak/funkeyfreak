## A Little More About Me

I ♥️ building things

I graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science in 2015, and followed with my M.S. in 2016. As for my future career endeavors, I am seeking to narrow my focus into the data sciences, data visualization, augmented reality, and IoT based data processing/servicing. My current career prospects include general applications development, VR/augmented reality development, software architecting, and systems design/development.

I am an avid programmer, and enjoy the challenges brought to me by Java, PHP, golang, React, and dotnet core/c#. I also enjoy pairing this technology with the latest UI technology, including React and Redux, TypeScript, and the many, many flavors of CSS. This, of course, comes with the responsibility of writing well tested code while also ensuring my comments do not rely on complete application knowledge. I also am a team player, ensuring the production of well written and responsive code reviews, reducing communication friction between other developers, my manager, and myself, and ensuring that all tasks are completed with the utmost rigor, competence, and attention to detail.

But alas, I am not a simple engineer - I have plenty of passions to keep me busy! I would speak more to this, but the real-estate here is limited! Outside of software development, I also love the outdoors, doing activities ranging from mountain biking and hiking, to soccer and golf. I am a photographer, I invite you to stalk follow me on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dalinwilliams/).

I will never put any less than 100% of myself into anything that I do; I will always strive to maximize my potential. Life is far too short for taking one's time.
