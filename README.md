## A Little More About Me

I ♥️ building things.

I graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science in 2015, followed by my M.S. in 2016. As for my future career endeavors, I am seeking to narrow my focus to the data sciences, data visualization, augmented reality, and IoT-based data processing/servicing. My career prospects include general applications development, VR/augmented reality development, software architecting, and systems design/development.

I am an avid programmer and enjoy the challenges brought to me by Java, PHP, golang, React, and dotnet core/c#. I also enjoy pairing this technology with the latest UI technology, including React and Redux, TypeScript, and many CSS flavors. This comes with the responsibility of writing well-tested code while ensuring my comments rely on something other than complete application knowledge. I am also a team player, ensuring the production of well-written and responsive code reviews, reducing communication friction between other developers, my manager, and myself, and ensuring all tasks are completed rigorously, competently, and with attention to detail.

But alas, I am not a simple engineer - I have plenty of passions to keep me busy! I would speak more to this, but the real estate here is limited! Outside of software development, I also love the outdoors, doing activities ranging from mountain biking and hiking to soccer and golf. As a photographer, I invite you to stalk and follow me on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dalinwilliams/).

I will always put at least 100% of myself into anything I do; I will always strive to maximize my potential. Life is far too short for taking one's time.
